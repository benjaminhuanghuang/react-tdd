## React libraries
- Babel: Convert ES6 to ES5 syntax

- Webpack: JS bundler

- React-Dom: A dependency library for Enzyme used to manually render a React component into DOM

- React-test-renderer: Dependency library for Enzyme

## Test Library
- Mocha: Testing Framework, used to run tests and show the results.

- Chai: Assertion Library, used to determine under what conditions a test will pass.

- Sinon: Mocking Utility, used to mock functions to isolate code and mimic test scenarios.

- Enzyme: React Testing Utility, used to mount React components on a virtual DOM, which allows you to interact with the React component without actually rendering the component in a browser.
