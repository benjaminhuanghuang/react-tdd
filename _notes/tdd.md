## Types of testing
- Unit Testing: In unit testing we test to be sure a component produces an expected output when given an input.

- Integration Testing: Here individual test units are combined and tested as a group at a given time.

- Performance Testing: In performance testing, we test for the speed of the system.

- Usability Testing: Here we test the product in the perspective of the customers, how easy it is to use the 
product.

- Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is used to test if the product meets the requirement of the customer.

- Regression Testing: Regression testing test to ensure if a modification is working correctly or if some functionalities broke as a result of modifications.
