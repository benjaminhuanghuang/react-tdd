## Run ES6 with mocha
- https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/compilers-deprecation
```
     "test:single":"mocha --require js:babel-core/register \"tests/**/math_test.js\""
```

## Run UT without CSS
```
    npm i ignore-styles -D
```
package.json
```
    "mocha:app": "mocha --require babel-core/register --require ignore-styles \"tests/**/*.spec.js\"",
```
## Enzyme
- http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/index.html
To work with React16
```
    npm i --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

Enzyme requires react-test-renderer for **React15**:
```
    $ npm i -D react-test-renderer@15 enzyme-adapter-react-15
```
Enzyme expects an adapter to be configured. 
To configure an adapter, you should call `Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })`
before using any of Enzyme's top level APIs, where `Adapter` is the adapter
corresponding to the library currently being tested. 
http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/index.html

If you use Create React App, you can create a src/setupTests.js and put inside it the Enzyme initialization code.


Enzyme render functions
- shallow() is the simplest form of rendering a component with Enzyme. It only renders the component but not the content of components which are children to this component. It makes it possible to test the component in isolation. Be used for component tests in isolation (unit tests, lightweight integration).

- mount() renders all child components as well. It renders the whole component hierarchy. 
It is used for **real** integration tests.

- render() is similar to mount(), it renders all child components. But from a performance point of view, it is less expensive than mount(), because it **doesnâ€™t run the lifecycle methods** of the component. So if you need access to child components but are not interested in lifecycle methods, you can use render() instead of mount().

Simulate UI evnet
```
    var subject = shallow(<Calculator />);
    subject.find('button').simulate('click');
    
    const resultText = subject.find('.result').text();
    expect(resultText).to.equal('2')
```

## Stub funciton
```
    var mockParseEquation = sinon.stub(math, "parseEquation"); 
    expect(mockParseEquation.calledOnce).to.be.true;
    expect(mockParseEquation.getCall(0).args[0]).to.equal('1 + 1');
```
Replaces object.method with a stub function.
